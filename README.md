**This challenge requires basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Build the panel and bring it as close to the design as possible.

Users must be able to:

- See the optimal layout for the website depending on the device screen size
- View hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle between displaying daily, weekly and monthly statistics

### Expected behavior

- The text of the previous period should be changed based on the active period. For Diary, it should read "Yesterday", for example "Yesterday - 2 hours". For Weekly, it should read "Last week", for example "Last week - 32 hours". For monthly, it should read "Last month", for example "Last month - 19 hours".
